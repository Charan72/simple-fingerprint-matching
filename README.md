# simple-fingerprint-matching
Humans fingerprints are sourceful in details which is called minutiae, which can be used as identification marks for fingerprint verification. This project is to study on fingerprint recognition system based on minutia point based matching which is frequently used in many fingerprint algorithms and techniques. This method of this project include that how the minutia points are extracted from the fingerprint images . Image enhancement, image segmentation, minutia extraction and minutia matching these stages are the main themes of our project. This project usually coded in Matlab platform. And Graphical user interface also designed Matlab
